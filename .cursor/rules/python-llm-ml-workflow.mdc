# Coding Guidelines

## 1. Pythonic Practices

- **Elegance and Readability:** Strive for elegant and Pythonic code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for code style, with Ruff as the primary linter and formatter.
- **Explicit over Implicit:** Favor explicit code that clearly communicates its intent over implicit, overly concise code.
- **Zen of Python:** Keep the Zen of Python in mind when making design decisions.

## 2. Modular Design

- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module/file should have a well-defined, single responsibility.
- **Reusable Components:** Develop reusable functions and classes, favoring composition over inheritance.
- **Package Structure:** Organize code into logical packages and modules.

## 3. Code Quality

- **Comprehensive Type Annotations:** All functions, methods, and class members must have type annotations, using the most specific types possible.
- **Detailed Docstrings:** All functions, methods, and classes must have Google-style docstrings, thoroughly explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised. Include usage examples where helpful.
- **Thorough Unit Testing:** Aim for high test coverage (90% or higher) using `pytest`. Test both common cases and edge cases.
- **Robust Exception Handling:** Use specific exception types, provide informative error messages, and handle exceptions gracefully. Implement custom exception classes when needed. Avoid bare `except` clauses.
- **Logging:** Employ the `logging` module judiciously to log important events, warnings, and errors.

## 4. ML/AI Specific Guidelines

- **Experiment Configuration:** Use `hydra` or `yaml` for clear and reproducible experiment configurations.
- **Data Pipeline Management:** Employ scripts or tools like [dvc](mdc:https:/dvc.org) to manage data preprocessing and ensure reproducibility.
- **Model Versioning:** Utilize [git-lfs](mdc:https:/git-lfs.com) or cloud storage to track and manage model checkpoints effectively.
- **Experiment Logging:** Maintain comprehensive logs of experiments, including parameters, results, and environmental details.
- **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Dedicate a module or files for managing Prompt templates with version control.
- **Context Handling:** Implement efficient context management for conversations, using suitable data structures like deques.

## 5. Performance Optimization

- **Asynchronous Programming:** Leverage `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to maximize concurrency.
- **Caching:** Apply `functools.lru_cache`, `@cache` (Python 3.9+), or `fastapi.Depends` caching where appropriate.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Use [psutil](mdc:https:/pypi.org/project/psutil) or similar to monitor resource usage and identify bottlenecks.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Ensure proper release of unused resources to prevent memory leaks.
- **Concurrency:** Employ `concurrent.futures` or `asyncio` to manage concurrent tasks effectively.
- **Database Best Practices:** Design database schemas efficiently, optimize queries, and use indexes wisely.

## 6. API Development with FastAPI

- **Data Validation:** Use [Pydantic](mdc:https:/docs.pydantic.dev) models for rigorous request and response data validation.
- **Dependency Injection:** Effectively use FastAPI's dependency injection for managing dependencies.
- **Routing:** Define clear and RESTful API routes using FastAPI's `APIRouter`.
- **Background Tasks:** Utilize FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` or integrate with [Celery](mdc:https:/docs.celeryq.dev) for background processing.
- **Security:** Implement robust authentication and authorization (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
- **Documentation:** Auto-generate API documentation using FastAPI's OpenAPI support.
- **Versioning:** Plan for API versioning from the start (e.g., using URL prefixes or headers).
- **CORS:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings correctly.

# Code Example Requirements

- All functions must include type annotations.
- Must provide clear, Google-style docstrings.
- Key logic should be annotated with comments.
- Provide usage examples (e.g., in the `tests/` directory or as a `__main__` section).
- Include error handling.
- Use `ruff` for code formatting.

# Others

- **Prioritize new features in Python 3.10+.**
- **When explaining code, provide clear logical explanations and code comments.**
- **When making suggestions, explain the rationale and potential trade-offs.**
- **If code examples span multiple files, clearly indicate the file name.**
- **Do not over-engineer solutions. Strive for simplicity and maintainability while still being efficient.**
- **Favor modularity, but avoid over-modularization.**
- **Use the most modern and efficient libraries when appropriate, but justify their use and ensure they don't add unnecessary complexity.**
- **When providing solutions or examples, ensure they are self-contained and executable without requiring extensive modifications.**
- **If a request is unclear or lacks sufficient information, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.**
- **Always consider the security implications of your code, especially when dealing with user inputs and external data.**
- **Actively use and promote best practices for the specific tasks at hand (LLM app development, data cleaning, demo creation, etc.).**
