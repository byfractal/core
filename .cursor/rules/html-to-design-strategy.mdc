## **Objective**  
You are an expert in **React, TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, LangChain, SGL, LLM, and Figma plugin development** as part of a **B2B SaaS ecosystem** for **product and design teams**.

Your primary role is to **assist, structure, and guide the development** of an AI-driven UX/UI recommendation system that leverages **quantitative and qualitative data** to optimize layouts.

This project integrates **HTML to Design via the Code.to.Design API** and **AI-based UX analysis**, **differentiating itself from Relume or Figma AI** by **merging analytics, user feedback, and behavioral data** to create **human-centric design improvements** with **measurable business impact**.

---

## **1. Extraction of UI Components via Code.to.Design API**  
📌 **HTML to Design**, using **[Code.to.Design](mdc:https:/code.to.design)**, extracts **components directly from a user’s website/app** and organizes them into a **custom library** following **Atomic Design principles** (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms).

👉 **Code.to.Design API promise**:  
*"The only API for HTML to Figma. Convert any HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into detailed designs to paste directly into Figma."*

### **Why this approach?**
✅ **Preserves visual identity** → Colors, typography, and styles remain faithful to the user’s design system.  
✅ **Eases implementation** → Designers and developers find components in Figma without unnecessary reinvention.  
✅ **Optimizes UX/UI consistency** → Ensures a **perfect match between the existing design and the optimized layout**.

---

## **2. Intelligent Rearrangement Based on User Feedback**  
Unlike traditional HTML/CSS generators, **our AI reuses extracted components** to **suggest UX/UI layout modifications** rather than creating new components.

📌 **Key Data Sources Analyzed** *(both qualitative & quantitative)*:  
- **Session replays** *(Amplitude, Mixpanel, PostHog, FullStory, Hotjar...)*  
- **User research** *(Interviews, UX surveys, usability tests, NPS feedback...)*  
- **Direct feedback** *(Polls, user comments, form responses)*  
- **Behavioral analytics** *(Heatmaps, conversion rates, engagement metrics...)*  

📌 **Key Differentiation vs. Relume & Figma AI**:  
Unlike existing solutions that rely **only on UI patterns**, **we merge quantitative and qualitative data** to **build a complete, unbiased picture**.  
This ensures that **our AI understands human behavior behind the data**, creating truly **human-centric UX/UI decisions** while **aligning with business objectives**.

## **3. Optimized Integration Workflow**  

📌 **System Workflow**:  

**User’s website/app**  
→ **HTML to Design (via Code.to.Design API)**  
→ **Extract UI components**  
→ **Analyze UX feedback (Replays, Amplitude, Mixpanel, PostHog... )**  
→ **AI-driven component reorganization (optimized layout)**  
→ **Generate new Figma layout with original components**  
→ **Provide quantified UX insights (acting as a UX Data Scientist)**  

Unlike **Relume and Figma AI Design**, our tool **not only rearranges existing components** but also **integrates deep behavioral insights** to optimize layout and user experience.  

---

## **4. Validation & Continuous Improvement via Behavioral Replays**  
⚠️ **Session replays are just an example** of **many qualitative feedback sources** available on **Amplitude, Mixpanel, PostHog, FullStory, Hotjar, etc.**  

📌 **Why use session replays?**  
✅ **Rich qualitative data** *(just like interviews, usability tests, and surveys)*  
✅ **Detects hidden friction points** *(delays, hesitations, user drop-offs...)*  
✅ **Complements declared feedback** *(actual behavior vs. user self-reported feedback)*  

👉 **Example Implementation with PostHog API**  
1. Extract structured **event data (clicks, inputs, navigation, abandonment, etc.)**  
2. Preprocess the data into **text-based UX insights**  
3. Inject the processed data into the **AI model (RAG & Prompt Engineering)**  

---

## **5. Prompt Engineering vs. RAG: Hybrid AI Approach**
📌 **Optimized hybrid approach for UX/UI recommendations**  

✅ **Primary approach: Prompt Engineering (90%)**  
- Uses **LLMs’ inherent UX/UI knowledge** (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)  
- Generates insights using **customized prompts**  
- **Fast, lightweight, and cost-effective**  

✅ **Complementary: RAG-based augmentation (10%)**  
- Injects **specialized UX knowledge** *(Material Design, iOS guidelines, conversion benchmarks...)*  
- Allows **progressive knowledge enrichment** without polluting the prompt system  

💡 **Why this hybrid model?**  
🔹 **Pragmatic**: Starts simple, adds complexity when necessary  
🔹 **Cost-efficient**: Reduces excessive API token usage  
🔹 **Scalable**: Gradually integrates **specialized UX best practices**

## **7. AI as a UX Data Scientist: Explaining & Quantifying Changes**  
🚀 **Beyond layout generation, our AI explains its recommendations like a UX Data Scientist.**  

✅ **Clearly justifies why modifications were made**  
✅ **Describes identified problems & applied solutions**  
✅ **Quantifies estimated UX impact & potential business benefits**  

💡 **Example AI-generated insight:**  
*"We detected a 12% drop-off rate on the checkout page due to form complexity.  
By reducing form fields and optimizing the UX flow, we estimate a potential **+7% conversion rate increase**."*  

👉 **This AI-driven explanation feature transforms our tool into an actual UX/UI co-pilot** for designers and PMs, making UX decisions more **data-driven and human-centric**.
