# Security Technology Choices

This document explains the reasoning behind our security technology choices and implementation approaches. It outlines why we selected specific libraries, frameworks, and methodologies over alternatives.

## Authentication Technologies

### JWT vs. Session-Based Authentication

**Choice: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**

We chose JWT over traditional session-based authentication for the following reasons:

1. **Stateless Architecture**: JWTs allow for a stateless authentication system, eliminating the need to store session data on the server. This improves scalability and reduces database load.

2. **Microservices Compatibility**: In a potential microservices architecture, JWTs can be easily validated across different services without sharing a session store.

3. **Mobile API Support**: JWTs work well with mobile applications and pure API backends, where maintaining sessions can be challenging.

4. **Performance**: By reducing database lookups for session validation, JWTs can offer better performance for high-traffic applications.

**Trade-offs Considered**:

- **Token Size**: JWTs are larger than session IDs, increasing request size slightly.
- **Revocation Complexity**: Revoking JWTs before expiration requires additional infrastructure like a token blacklist.

We mitigated these trade-offs by implementing token blacklisting and keeping token payloads minimal.

### JWT Library Selection

**Choice: PyJWT + python-jose**

We chose PyJWT as our primary JWT library, with python-jose for additional cryptographic operations because:

1. **Security**: Both libraries have undergone security audits and are actively maintained.

2. **Feature Completeness**: PyJWT provides all necessary JWT functionality with good performance, while python-jose offers additional cryptographic utilities when needed.

3. **Industry Adoption**: These libraries are widely used in production environments and have strong community support.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **AuthLib**: Offers more features but is more complex and has a larger footprint.
- **PyJWKClient**: More specialized for JWK handling, which we didn't require.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Choice: TOTP with PyOTP**

We implemented TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords) for MFA using the PyOTP library because:

1. **User Experience**: TOTP works with popular authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy) that many users already have installed.

2. **Security**: Time-based codes provide strong security without requiring additional infrastructure like SMS gateways.

3. **Reliability**: Unlike SMS-based MFA, TOTP doesn't depend on cellular network availability or phone numbers.

4. **Standardization**: TOTP follows RFC 6238, ensuring compatibility with many authentication apps and systems.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **SMS-Based OTP**: Rejected due to vulnerabilities like SIM swapping and SMS interception.
- **Push Notifications**: Would require developing and maintaining mobile apps.
- **FIDO/WebAuthn**: While more secure, requires specialized hardware not all users have.

## Authorization Approach

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Choice: Custom RBAC Implementation with FastAPI Security Scopes**

We implemented RBAC using FastAPI's security scopes mechanism because:

1. **Integration**: It integrates seamlessly with FastAPI's dependency injection system.

2. **Simplicity**: Provides a clean way to define and enforce role requirements at the endpoint level.

3. **Performance**: Validation happens at the routing layer, preventing unnecessary code execution for unauthorized requests.

4. **Flexibility**: Our implementation can be extended to support more complex permission schemes in the future.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Casbin**: More powerful for complex authorization rules but adds complexity and dependencies.
- **OPA (Open Policy Agent)**: Great for complex policy evaluation but would be overkill for our current needs.
- **FastAPI-Permissions**: Limited flexibility compared to our custom implementation.

## Data Protection

### Encryption Library

**Choice: cryptography**

We chose the Python `cryptography` library for implementing our encryption utilities because:

1. **Modern Implementation**: Provides modern, secure implementations of cryptographic primitives.

2. **Audited Code**: Regularly audited for security vulnerabilities.

3. **Complete Solution**: Offers all the cryptographic operations we need in one package.

4. **Performance**: Includes optimized C implementations of cryptographic algorithms.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **PyCrypto**: Deprecated and no longer maintained.
- **PyCryptodome**: Good alternative but less widely used in production environments.
- **M2Crypto**: Performance advantages but more complex to use and has additional dependencies.

### Encryption Algorithm

**Choice: AES-256 in CBC Mode with HMAC-SHA256**

We chose AES-256 with CBC mode and HMAC authentication because:

1. **Industry Standard**: AES-256 is a well-established encryption standard used worldwide.

2. **Security Strength**: 256-bit keys provide a very high level of security against brute force attacks.

3. **Authenticated Encryption**: By adding HMAC-SHA256, we ensure both confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data.

4. **Compatibility**: Widely supported across platforms if we need to decrypt in different environments.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **AES-GCM**: Provides authenticated encryption in one step but has more complex implementation requirements.
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305**: Excellent modern cipher but less widely supported.
- **RSA**: Asymmetric encryption would be overkill for our data encryption needs and less efficient.

### Key Management

**Choice: Two-Tier Key System with Master Key**

We implemented a two-tier key system where:

1. A master key encrypts individual data encryption keys (DEKs)
2. DEKs encrypt actual data

This approach was chosen because:

1. **Key Rotation**: Allows rotating individual DEKs without re-encrypting all data.

2. **Compromise Limitation**: If a single DEK is compromised, only data encrypted with that key is at risk.

3. **Performance**: Using different DEKs for different data sets optimizes encryption/decryption operations.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Single Key**: Simpler but lacks rotation capabilities.
- **KMS Solution**: External Key Management Systems (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault) would be ideal for production but add infrastructure complexity.

## Request Protection

### Rate Limiting

**Choice: Redis-Based Rate Limiting with Multiple Strategies**

We implemented rate limiting using Redis as the backend with both fixed window and sliding window strategies because:

1. **Distributed Architecture**: Redis allows rate limiting to work across multiple application instances.

2. **Persistence**: Rate limit counters survive application restarts.

3. **Performance**: Redis provides high-performance, in-memory operations with minimal latency.

4. **Flexibility**: Our implementation supports different rate limiting strategies for different use cases.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **In-Memory Rate Limiting**: Simpler but doesn't work in distributed environments.
- **Database-Based Rate Limiting**: Higher latency and more resource-intensive.
- **Third-Party Services**: Would add external dependencies and potential points of failure.

### Input Validation

**Choice: Multi-Layer Validation (Pydantic + Custom Middleware)**

We implemented a multi-layered approach to input validation:

1. **Pydantic Models**: For schema validation and type checking
2. **Custom Middleware**: For detecting attack patterns

This approach was chosen because:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Provides multiple layers of protection against malicious inputs.

2. **Specialized Protection**: Custom middleware can detect specific attack patterns that schema validation might miss.

3. **Performance Balance**: Pydantic handles most validation efficiently, while more expensive pattern matching only runs when needed.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: Schema validation focuses on business rules, while security validation focuses on attack prevention.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **WAF-Only Approach**: External Web Application Firewalls provide great protection but don't eliminate the need for application-level validation.
- **Rule-Based Validation Libraries**: Many are either too general or too narrow in scope.

## Middleware Architecture

**Choice: Starlette Middleware Base Classes**

We built our security middlewares using Starlette's BaseHTTPMiddleware because:

1. **FastAPI Compatibility**: Seamless integration with FastAPI, which is built on Starlette.

2. **Async Support**: Full support for asynchronous request handling, maintaining FastAPI's performance benefits.

3. **Request Modification**: Allows examining and modifying requests before they reach route handlers.

4. **Flexibility**: Provides a clean, object-oriented way to implement complex middleware logic.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **ASGI Middleware**: Lower level and more complex to implement correctly.
- **Function-Based Middleware**: Less maintainable for complex middleware logic.
- **FastAPI Dependencies**: Great for per-route protection but doesn't provide global request processing.

## Password Security

**Choice: Bcrypt via passlib**

We chose Bcrypt (through the passlib library) for password hashing because:

1. **Adaptive Complexity**: Bcrypt can be tuned to become more computationally intensive as hardware improves.

2. **Built-in Salt**: Automatically handles salt generation and storage.

3. **Resistance to Hardware Attacks**: Designed to be difficult to accelerate using specialized hardware.

4. **Industry Standard**: Widely recognized as a secure password hashing algorithm.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Argon2**: Newer and theoretically more secure but less widely deployed.
- **PBKDF2**: Good alternative but generally requires more iterations than Bcrypt for equivalent security.
- **Scrypt**: Memory-hard function with great security properties but more complex to implement correctly.
