# Backend Security Implementation

This document provides an overview of the security measures implemented in the backend of our application.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT/OAuth2 Implementation**:
  - Secure token generation with `PyJWT`
  - Token rotation with unique JTI identifiers
  - Token blacklisting mechanism
  - Configurable token expiration

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
  - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) implementation with `pyotp`
  - QR code generation for easy setup
  - Secure secret management

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Fine-grained permission system with roles and scopes
  - Three primary roles: USER, ADMIN, SUPERADMIN
  - Security scope validation at the endpoint level

### 2. Middleware Protections

- **JWT Validation Middleware**:
  - Automatic token validation for all protected routes
  - Public path exclusions for authentication-free endpoints
  - User information extraction for use in request handlers

- **Rate Limiting Middleware**:
  - Configurable global and path-specific rate limits
  - Fixed window and sliding window strategies
  - Redis-based distributed rate limiting
  - Protection against brute force attacks

- **Input Validation Middleware**:
  - Protection against common attack vectors:
    - SQL Injection
    - NoSQL Injection
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - Path Traversal
    - Command Injection
  - Configurable validation rules with different strictness levels

### 3. Data Protection and Encryption

- **AES-256 Encryption**:
  - Strong encryption for sensitive data
  - Key rotation mechanism
  - Master key system for data encryption keys

- **Password Security**:
  - Bcrypt hashing with salt
  - Password complexity validation
  - Secure random password generation

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
  - Comprehensive validation utilities
  - HTML content sanitization
  - String normalization and character filtering

## Security Configuration

Environment variables needed for security features:

```
# JWT Authentication
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_at_least_32_characters_long
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7

# Encryption
MASTER_KEY=your_master_encryption_key_at_least_32_characters
ENCRYPTION_KEYS_FILE=encryption_keys.json

# Rate Limiting
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
RATE_LIMIT_DEFAULT=100
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS=60

# CORS Settings
CORS_ORIGINS=*
```

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Environment Variables**: Store all security-related environment variables securely (not in code repositories)
2. **Redis for Token Blacklisting**: Replace in-memory token blacklist with Redis in production
3. **HTTPS**: Ensure all API communications use HTTPS
4. **Security Audits**: Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing
5. **Dependency Scanning**: Monitor dependencies for security vulnerabilities
6. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for security events
7. **Strong Password Policies**: Enforce strong passwords for all users
8. **Rate Limiting**: Configure appropriate rate limits based on your application's needs
9. **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate encryption keys

## Implementation Details

All security-related functionality is implemented in the `backend/security` module:

- `auth.py`: Authentication and authorization with JWT/OAuth2, MFA, and RBAC
- `encryption.py`: Data encryption utilities with AES-256 and key rotation
- `validation.py`: Input validation and sanitization utilities
- `middlewares/*.py`: Security middleware components
