## Overview

Our security implementation follows the Defense in Depth strategy, applying multiple layers of security controls throughout the application. We adhere to OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard) Level 1 requirements with many Level 2 controls in place.

## Security Components

Our security architecture consists of the following core components:

1. **Authentication Module**: JWT/OAuth2-based authentication with token rotation, refresh tokens, and MFA.
2. **Authorization System**: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with fine-grained permissions.
3. **Security Middlewares**: Validation, rate limiting, and JWT verification at the request/response level.
4. **Encryption Utilities**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data with key rotation.
5. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation and sanitization utilities.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Technology Choices

- **JWT/OAuth2**: We chose JWT (JSON Web Tokens) over session-based authentication for the following reasons:
  - Stateless nature makes it ideal for distributed systems
  - Reduced database lookups for authentication verification
  - Support for short-lived tokens with refresh mechanism
  - Ability to encode user claims securely

- **PyJWT + python-jose**: Selected over other JWT libraries due to:
  - Comprehensive support for cryptographic algorithms
  - Active maintenance and security updates
  - Great integration with FastAPI

- **MFA with TOTP**: We implemented TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) using pyotp because:
  - Industry standard for MFA implementations
  - Compatibility with authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)
  - Doesn't require SMS infrastructure, avoiding SMS interception risks
  - Time-based nature provides better security than sequence-based approaches

- **RBAC**: Selected role-based access control over other authorization models because:
  - Simplifies permission management through role assignments
  - Aligns with business organizational structures
  - Easier to audit and maintain compared to ACL-based systems

### Implementation Details

- **Token Structure**:
  - Short-lived access tokens (30 minutes by default, configurable)
  - Longer-lived refresh tokens (7 days by default, configurable)
  - JWT payload includes user ID, roles, permissions, expiration, and unique token ID
  
- **Token Security Measures**:
  - Token blacklisting for revocation
  - JTI (JWT ID) for uniqueness and tracking
  - Token rotation on each refresh
  - Scope validation in middleware and endpoint dependencies

- **MFA Implementation**:
  - TOTP with 30-second time window
  - QR code generation for easy setup with authenticator apps
  - Configurable enforcement for specific endpoints or user roles

## Data Validation and Sanitization

### Technology Choices

- **Pydantic**: Chosen for input validation because:
  - Native integration with FastAPI
  - Type validation with Python type hints
  - Extensible validation system
  - Excellent performance compared to alternatives

- **Custom Middleware**: Implemented in addition to Pydantic validation to:
  - Catch attacks before they reach route handlers
  - Implement more specialized validation rules
  - Provide better logging and monitoring of validation failures

### Implementation Details

- **Validation Levels**:
  - Schema validation via Pydantic models (type checking, constraints)
  - Content validation for detecting malicious patterns (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
  - Business rule validation at the service layer

- **Protection Against Common Attacks**:
  - SQL Injection detection and prevention
  - XSS pattern recognition
  - Path traversal attack detection
  - Command injection prevention
  - NoSQL injection protection

## Encryption and Data Protection

### Technology Choices

- **AES-256**: Selected for data encryption due to:
  - Industry standard with strong security properties
  - Balance of performance and security
  - Wide implementation support
  - Resistance to known attacks when properly implemented

- **Cryptography Library**: Chosen over other Python cryptography libraries because:
  - Modern, audited implementation of cryptographic primitives
  - Follows security best practices by default
  - Active maintenance and security patches
  - Better safeguards against common implementation errors

### Implementation Details

- **Encryption Strategy**:
  - Two-tier key system: master key for data encryption keys (DEKs)
  - Key rotation for DEKs without re-encrypting all data
  - Initialization vector (IV) uniqueness per encryption operation
  - MAC authentication for integrity verification

- **Password Security**:
  - Bcrypt hashing with adaptive work factor
  - Salt generation for each password
  - Password complexity validation

## Attack Prevention

### Technology Choices

- **Rate Limiting with Redis**: Chosen because:
  - Distributed limiting across multiple application instances
  - Persistence of rate limit counters between application restarts
  - Performance and scalability advantages
  - Configurable window sizes and limit thresholds

- **Input Validation Middleware**: Implemented custom middleware instead of relying solely on off-the-shelf solutions to:
  - Tailor detection to our specific application needs
  - Control false positive rates
  - Integrate with our logging and monitoring systems

### Implementation Details

- **Rate Limiting Implementation**:
  - Multiple strategies: fixed window, sliding window
  - Per-endpoint and global rate limits
  - IP-based, user-based, and combined limiting options
  - Configurable response handling (reject vs. delay)

- **Protection Levels**:
  - Basic: General rate limits to prevent abuse
  - Enhanced: Lower limits for sensitive operations
  - Strict: More aggressive limits with CAPTCHA challenges for suspicious patterns

## Tech Stack

Our security implementation relies on the following key libraries and technologies:

- **FastAPI**: Modern, high-performance web framework with built-in security features
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **PyJWT + python-jose**: JWT implementation with cryptographic backends
- **Passlib + bcrypt**: Password hashing and verification
- **Cryptography**: Modern cryptographic primitives
- **PyOTP**: Time-based One-Time Password implementation
- **Redis**: For distributed rate limiting and token blacklisting (in production)

## Implementation Details

All security components are modularly implemented in the `backend/security` directory:

- `auth.py`: Authentication and authorization (JWT, MFA, RBAC)
- `encryption.py`: Data encryption and key management
- `validation.py`: Input validation and sanitization utilities
- `middlewares/jwt.py`: JWT verification middleware
- `middlewares/rate_limiter.py`: Rate limiting middleware
- `middlewares/input_validation.py`: Input validation middleware

## Deployment Recommendations

For production deployments, we recommend:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use a secure vault solution (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) for managing secrets
   - Rotate JWT and encryption keys periodically

2. **Infrastructure**:
   - Deploy behind a Web Application Firewall (Cloudflare, AWS WAF)
   - Implement a proper reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik) with TLS termination
   - Use Redis for distributed state (rate limiting, token blacklisting)

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Implement centralized logging (ELK stack, Grafana+Loki)
   - Set up alerts for suspicious patterns
   - Regularly review security logs

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Integrate security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning)
   - Implement automated vulnerability scanning
   - Add security testing to deployment workflows

5. **Regular Maintenance**:
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Follow security bulletins
   - Conduct periodic security reviews and testing
